  # - Go to 'https://github.com/settings/tokens/new' and generate a Token with only the
  # `public_repo` scope enabled
  # - Call `travis encrypt $github_token` where $github_token is the token you got in the previous
  # step and `travis` is the official Travis CI gem (see https://rubygems.org/gems/travis/)
  # - Enter the "encrypted value" below

    # IMPORTANT Ruby regex to match tags. Required, or travis won't trigger deploys when a new tag
